I mostly concern embedded security, firmware reversing, and program analysis. This site is dedicated to make some memory about my progress. Currently, I prioritize to share as the following: 
- firmware analysis, fuzz testing, and exploits on bare-metal and RTOS targets.
- firmware reversing, e.g., baseband, ECU, routers.
- hardware security, e.g., hardware-in-the-loop testing.
- practical program analysis, such as reaching definition analysis, dataflow analysis.
- advanced concepts of some high-quality tools, e.g., fuzzware, avatar2, PANDA, Unicorn.


In addition, I have a plan to write down a series of posts on writing for academic purposes in order to keep track of what I have learned. Moreover, I have found a lot of misconceptions. For example, it is insufficient to correct one's writing relying only on off-the-shelf tools, such as DeepL writing or Grammarly, because they do not fully understand what one has emphasized. One needs to figure things out while writing anything down.

Even though I know these somehow, I have not been good enough yet and still make a lot of mistakes. This is the primary reason that I would like to do so. Cool, that is a good starting point :)
