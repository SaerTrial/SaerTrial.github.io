I mostly concern embedded security, firmware reversing, and program analysis. This site is dedicated to make some memory about my progress. Currently, I prioritize to share as the following: 
- firmware analysis, fuzz testing, and exploits on bare-metal and RTOS targets.
- firmware reversing, e.g., baseband, ECU, routers.
- hardware security, e.g., hardware-in-the-loop testing.
- practical program analysis, such as reaching definition analysis, dataflow analysis.
- advanced concepts of some high-quality tools, e.g., fuzzware, avatar2, PANDA, Unicorn.
