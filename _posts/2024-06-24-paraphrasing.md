This post introduces paraphrasing, in terms of its definition, why and how.

# What is paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is a way of presenting a text, keeping the same meaning, but using different words and phrasing. A paraphrase may result in a longer, rather than shorter, version of the original text.

# Why paraphrasing?

Paraphrasing is a useful skill for making notes from readings, note-taking in lectures, and explaining information in tables, charts and diagrams. Moreover, when writing an academic paper and referring to another paper, paraphrasing its main idea is necessary to avoid plagiarism. 

# When to paraphrase

Paraphrase short sections of work only; a sentence of two or a short paragraph.

- As an alternative to a direct quotation
- To rewrite someone else's ideas without changing the meaning (I just mention in the previous section)
- To express someone else's ideas in your own words
- To support claims in, or provide evidence for, your writing


# How to paraphrase

There are a few steps to follow:
- Understand the idea
- Understand the train of logic and how sentences relate to each other
- Identify key points (outline), including content and cohension (linkers)
- Rewrite the original text on your own and make some changes in the following:
  - Synonyms: make sure you retain the same meaning when it comes to cohesive devices
  - Order in words: old information comes out before the new one. Put the most important one always at the end.
  - Parts of speech: change verb to noun, active to passive
- Make sure your paraphrasing fits the author's attitude, which will be discussed in the preceeding section because of its importance.

# Linkers

Linkers bridge the logic of each part between clauses, and sentences. Changing the positions of linkers may affect the original meaning and authors' attutudes. Hence, it is cautious to weigh up their positions while paraphrasing.

There are a few exercises to identify the meaning relationship by the type of cohesive devices (if I classify in a right way).
1. Many invertebrates, on the other hand, such as snails and worms and crustacea, have a spiral pattern of cleavage.
2. Similarly, the muscles will not grow in length unless they are attached to tendons and bones so that as the bones lengthen, they are stretched.  
3. Besides being a theory about the basis and origin of knowledge and the contents of our minds in general, empiricism is also sometimes a methodology.  
4. As opposed to this, Locke is often supposed to be saying that, in addition to properties, things have a "substratum" which "supports" their properties.  
5. Consequently in a sense one may speak of the Common Law as unwritten law in contrast with Statute Law, which is written law.  

Let us analyze one by one:
1. "on the other hand" is the contrastive word. The main point to put it at such a position is to emphasize some invertebrates having a spiral pattern. If we put "on the other hand" at the end, the emphasis will come over to "a spiral pattern. Other contrastive words include: in contrary to, however, but, unlike, by contrast
2. "Similarly" is one of comparative words. The position where it gets placed at is the head of sentence, so it affects the whole sentence here. Other comparative words consist of: likewise, more or less the same way

3. "Besides" is the additive word. This word takes an effect on "empiricism", meaning that it is not just a theory but a methodology. If we consider paraphrasing this sentence, it would be better to pick up another additive word to retain +ing form. Other additive words include:
    - apart from (good one in this case, because apart from verb+ing), in addition to, except, not only but also, other than, while, etc. Using "while" is fine here but you need to add more things to clarity this is not the contrastive use.
    - There are differences between furthermore and moreover. "furthermore" indicates adding a new point while "moreover" adds detail for the same point.
    - Notably, beside + comma is informal, because the meaning presented is not strong. The better use is to beside + statement.
  
4. "As opposed to this" stress on the previous sentence.

5. "Consequently" is the causal word. It affect the whole sentence. Other causal cases are composed of: as a result, accordingly, hence, therefore, thus, so, resulting from … is …,  on this basis, because (of)..

Change the grammar of following text, and I provide my answers sandwitched by parentheses:
- change nouns to verbs
  - This rewriting of history was not so much a matter of a new start. (This rewriting of history rarely related to a new start)
  - Here he lives with the labourers in one of the barrack rooms, and out of his small earnings makes a start at having a house built. (Here he lives with the labourers in one of the barrack rooms, and earns the small amount of money to start the building of a house.)
- change verbs to nouns 
  - The Normans invaded in 1066. (The Norman implemented an invasion in 1066)

  - We can relate a study of this kind to texts in other media too. (A study of this kind cannot be related by us to texts in other media too)
  - In this treatment the teacher can use a variety of techniques to elicit the language learners already know. (In this treatment, a variety of techniques to elicit the language already figured by learners can be used by the teacher)
- break up sentences 
  - Given the extent to which deforestation increased markedly in the four southern states during 1987 and 1988, it is heartening news that during the early part of the 1989 dry season the burning seemed to have been curtailed somewhat, due to a combination of policy changes, better controls on burning, and most important of all an exceptionally wet "dry" season. (Given the extent to which deforestation increased markedly in the four southern states during 1987 and 1988, there is heartening news.

  - In 1851 the average family size was 4.7, roughly the same as it had been in the seventeenth century, but the 1½ million couples who married during the 1860s, which the historian G. M. Young described as the best decade in English history to have been brought up in, raised the figure to 6.2.

Young described the period of time as the best decade in English history to have been brought up in, raised the figure to 6.2.)
- combine sentences 
  - Tropical forests are defined here as evergreen or partly evergreen forests. They grow in areas receiving not less than 100 mm of precipitation in any month for two out of three years. The mean annual temperature is 24-plus degrees Celsius. The area is essentially frost-free. (Tropical forests are defined here as evergreen or partly evergreen forests, which grow in the essentially frost-free areas receiving not less than 100 mm of precipitation in any month for two out of three years with the mean annual temperature of 24-plus degrees Celsius.)
  - The third National Government followed upon the resignation of the Liberal ministers and of the free trader, Snowden. This happened in September 1932. After this it became little more than a Conservative government. A few ex-Labour and Liberal politicians were added. They all owed their seats to an electoral pact with the Conservatives.

# Takeaway

While paraphrasing, keep in mind:
- positions of linkers matter so much. The head position impacts the whole sentence; the middle one is more specific to certain contents; the tail position is either specific or global
- do not alter the author's attitude
- make sure correct use of a linker
