This post introduces paraphrasing, in terms of its definition, why and how.

## What is paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is a way of presenting a text, keeping the same meaning, but using different words and phrasing. A paraphrase may result in a longer, rather than shorter, version of the original text.

## Why paraphrasing?

Paraphrasing is a useful skill for making notes from readings, note-taking in lectures, and explaining information in tables, charts and diagrams. Moreover, when writing an academic paper and referring to another paper, paraphrasing its main idea is necessary to avoid plagiarism. 

## When to paraphrase

Paraphrase short sections of work only; a sentence of two or a short paragraph.

- As an alternative to a direct quotation
- To rewrite someone else's ideas without changing the meaning (I just mention in the previous section)
- To express someone else's ideas in your own words
- To support claims in, or provide evidence for, your writing


## How to paraphrase

There are a few steps to follow:
- Understand the idea
- Understand the train of logic and how sentences relate to each other
- Identify key points (outline), including content and cohension (linkers)
- Rewrite the original text on your own and make some changes in the following:
  - Synonyms: make sure you retain the same meaning when it comes to cohesive devices
  - Order in words: old information comes out before the new one. Put the most important one always at the end.
  - Parts of speech: change verb to noun, active to passive
- Make sure your paraphrasing fits the author's attitude, which will be discussed in the preceeding section because of its importance.

## Linkers

Linkers bridge the logic of each part between clauses, and sentences. Changing the positions of linkers may affect the original meaning and authors' attutudes. Hence, it is cautious to weigh up their positions while paraphrasing.

There are a few exercises to identify the meaning relationship by the type of cohesive devices (if I classify in a right way).
1. Many invertebrates, on the other hand, such as snails and worms and crustacea, have a spiral pattern of cleavage.
2. Similarly, the muscles will not grow in length unless they are attached to tendons and bones so that as the bones lengthen, they are stretched.  
3. Besides being a theory about the basis and origin of knowledge and the contents of our minds in general, empiricism is also sometimes a methodology.  
4. As opposed to this, Locke is often supposed to be saying that, in addition to properties, things have a "substratum" which "supports" their properties.  
5. Consequently in a sense one may speak of the Common Law as unwritten law in contrast with Statute Law, which is written law.  

Let us analyze one by one:
1. "on the other hand" is the contrastive word. The main point to put it at such a position is to emphasize some invertebrates having a spiral pattern. If we put "on the other hand" at the end, the emphasis will come over to "a spiral pattern.

    Other contrastive words include 
    - in contrary to, however, but, unlike, by contrast

2. "Similarly" is one of comparative words. The position where it gets placed at is the head of sentence, so it affects the whole sentence here. 

    Other comparative words consist of
    - likewise
    - more or less the same way

3. "Besides" is the additive word. This word takes an effect on "empiricism", meaning that it is not just a theory but a methodology. If we consider paraphrasing this sentence, it would be better to pick up another additive word to retain +ing form.

    Other additive words include:
    - apart from (good one in this case, because apart from verb+ing), in addition to, except, not only but also, other than, while, etc. Using "while" is fine here but you need to add more things to clarity this is not the contrastive use.
    - There are differences between furthermore and moreover. "furthermore" indicates adding a new point while "moreover" adds detail for the same point.
    - Notably, beside + comma is informal, because the meaning presented is not strong. The better use is to beside + statement.
  
4. "As opposed to this" stress on the previous sentence.

5. "Consequently" is the causal word. It affect the whole sentence.

    Other causal cases are composed of:
    - as a result, accordingly, hence, therefore, thus, so, resulting from … is …,  on this basis, because (of)..

# Takeaway

While paraphrasing, keep in mind:
- positions of linkers matter so much. The head position impacts the whole sentence; the middle one is more specific to certain contents; the tail position is either specific or global
- do not alter the author's attitude
- make sure correct use of a linker
