This is the first time when I have developed a heap exploitation on tcache. Even though a huge number of guys have agreed the difficulty in heap exploitation, I feel things are becoming way easier only if one has a solid understanding of heap and masters debugging. Not only does this post explains a solution, but also uncovers the pains that I went through while developing an exploit script. The [attachment]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/binary/2024-07-06-ciscn-2024-my-heap/attachment.zip) could be downloaded here.

## Resolving the application logic
### Reversing the given binary and checking the version of libc

What one needs to do first is to reverse engineer the application logic of the given binary, and check the version of libc in order to tell available exploitation techniques from already patches vulnerabilities in old libc distributions. Load this binary into Ghidra. We could find that its logic is very typical because there are five functions, including add, delete, edit, and show. However, A function located at 0x101495 catches my attention, which I name as `print_shell_addr` in Ghidra, and it plays a big role in poisoning heap. Its decompiled code looks like the following:

```c
void print_shell_addr(void)
{
  printf("magic address: %p\n",get_shell);
  printf("edit data:");
  read(0,ptr_chunk,0x10);
  return;
}
void get_shell(void)
{
  system("/bin/sh");
  return;
}
```

Here, it is clear that the challenge designer would like us to store the address of get_shell somewhere else, and attempt to get it executed. Before we dive into auditing other basic functions, we need to check out the version of the given libc binary. As the preceeding result shown, the version is 2.35.

```bash
$ strings libc.so.6 | grep "ubuntu"
GNU C Library (Ubuntu GLIBC 2.35-0ubuntu3.7) stable release version 2.35.
<https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glibc/+bugs>.
```

### Auditing 

Take a look at `menu`:
```
void menu(void)
{
  puts("magic heap has 4 choice : \nadd\ndelete\nshow\nedit");
  return;
}
```

Then turn to `add`:
```c
void add(void)
{
  int iVar1;
  
  puts("which one you choose?");
  iVar1 = choice();
  if (iVar1 == 1) {
    printf("size:");
    iVar1 = choice();
    ptr_chunk = (undefined *)malloc((long)iVar1);
  }
  else {
    malloc(0x4f0);
  }
  return;
}
```

This function allows users to allocate a chunk of specified size, and stores its pointer in a global variable `ptr_chunk`. Furthermore, I had no idea about the reason why `malloc(0x4f0);` serving non-one choices, has been put here while checking it firstly. However, this is very crucial and I will cover in later sections.

`delete` is easy to be understood:
```c
void del(void)
{
  free(ptr_chunk);
  puts("delete success!");
  return;
}
```

The `show` function does not print the content in the allocated buffer straightaway, but actually encodes it first then prints the encoded content. Nontheless, it is quite easy to decode and I will cover the decode algorithm in later sections when necessary.
```c
void show(void)
{
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  uint data;
  int idx;
  if (ptr_chunk != (undefined *)0x0) {
    printf("the data:");
    for (idx = 0; idx < 7; idx = idx + 1) {
      data = idx + 0x99U ^ (int)(char)ptr_chunk[idx];
      write(1,&data,1);
    }
  }
  return;
}
```

Finally, check `edit`:
```
void edit(void)
{
  printf("edit data:");
  read(0,ptr_chunk,8);
  return;
}
```

It is worth to mention that only first 8 bytes are allowed to modify. 

### Vulnerabilities

As far as I audit in the previous section, there is a relatively obvious vulnerability - use after free (UAF) and double free. In other words, one could allocate a heap buffer then modify its first 8 bytes after freeing the buffer. Moreover, this version of libc has enabled tcache to facilitate heap management in each thread without a need of mixing allocated chunks of other threads at the same management namespace.

Allocate a chunk of size 24 bytes, then free it:
```
magic heap has 4 choice : 
add
delete
show
edit
1
which one you choose?
1
size:24
magic heap has 4 choice : 
add
delete
show
edit
2
delete success!

fastbins
empty
unsortedbin
empty
smallbins

largebins

```

It could be seen in a way that our previously allocated chunk has been placed into a bin of size 0x20 in tcache. Furthermore, being able to modify first 16 bytes in a freed chunk allows us to accomplish double free on tcache.

By referring to another [write-up](https://bbs.kanxue.com/thread-282156.htm), the author claimed there are many approaches to exploit in libc 2.35 and only achieved exploitation by overwriting a return address at the stack to intercept control flow to get a shell. This post will also use the same approach with a slightly different implementation.

## tcache and tcache_perthread_struct

What does it look like when we free a tcache chunk? 

```
typedef struct tcache_entry
{
  struct tcache_entry *next;
  struct tcache_perthread_struct *key;
} tcache_entry;
```

As the above structure shown, a freed tcacahe chunk is stored in an entry of specific size, which consists of a pointer to the next freed chunk and a key for checking double free and throwing an exception. Hence, we can see that tcache is implemented as a singly-linked list, and an entry of each bin will maintain its own list once a freed chunk has been placed into that bin.

Furthermore, each entry is managed by a higher level structure, called tcache_perthread_struct. It maintains a record of available chunk for all bins and their corresponding pointers.

For simplicity, I refer to the [slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13NbUlNvj1Rm-Cc_E_Crp678c-mgzCi0BYfzXIzFB3zI/edit#slide=id.ga6f447a644_0_0) made by Yan in his pwn colleage course to demonstrate this structure:

![Image alt]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/binary/2024-07-06-ciscn-2024-my-heap/tcacahe_perthread_struct.png "tcache_perthread_struct and tcache_entry")

For example, the entry of size 16 bytes now maintains two freed chunks in its list and the record of count is shown as 2 accordingly.

Turning to tcache_perthread_struct, this is very important for exploitation. It structure is taken from [source code](https://codebrowser.dev/glibc/glibc/malloc/malloc.c.html#tcache_entry):
```
typedef struct tcache_perthread_struct
{
  uint16_t counts[TCACHE_MAX_BINS];
  tcache_entry *entries[TCACHE_MAX_BINS];
} tcache_perthread_struct;
```

Notably, the type of count record is uint16_t, which we will overwrite this value in our exploit.

There are more basics than we see here. I am going to present them when necessary as this makes a stronger storytelling.


## Leaking essential addresses

Typically, whenever we deal with heap challenges, the very first step is to leak information we need. In this case, it should be heap base address, from which we could overwrite tcache_perthread_struct, and libc base address, from which we could identify stack address by accessing `environ` variable.

### Leaking heap

Leaking heap base address is way easier that we just need to free an allocated tcache chunk.
```
pwndbg> x/10xg 0x55555555b2a0
0x55555555b2a0:	0x000000055555555b	0xf91a1fa7a1b5da87
pwndbg> vmmap heap
LEGEND: STACK | HEAP | CODE | DATA | RWX | RODATA
             Start                End Perm     Size Offset File
►   0x55555555b000     0x55555557c000 rw-p    21000      0 [heap]
    0x7ffff7d8f000     0x7ffff7d92000 rw-p     3000      0 [anon_7ffff7d8f]
```

Here, the heap base address stored in a freed chunk is right shifted by 12 bits. Let us take a look at its source code and understand why this address is placed that way:
```c
static __always_inline void
tcache_put (mchunkptr chunk, size_t tc_idx)
{
  tcache_entry *e = (tcache_entry *) chunk2mem (chunk);
  /* Mark this chunk as "in the tcache" so the test in _int_free will
     detect a double free.  */
  e->key = tcache_key;
  e->next = PROTECT_PTR (&e->next, tcache->entries[tc_idx]);
  tcache->entries[tc_idx] = e;
  ++(tcache->counts[tc_idx]);
}
```

As shown above, `e->next = PROTECT_PTR (&e->next, tcache->entries[tc_idx]);` is supposed to set up next pointer while freeing the current chunk. Moreover, the address of `e->next` is landing within heap, which is probably 0x55555555bxxx in this case. However, `tcache->entries[tc_idx]` is null as it just has been initialized. `PROTECT_PTR` is used for safe-linking to check double free. It masks the "next" pointers of the lists' chunks and perform allocation alignment checks on them.
```c
#define PROTECT_PTR(pos, ptr) \
  ((__typeof (ptr)) ((((size_t) pos) >> 12) ^ ((size_t) ptr)))
```

Hence, the above next pointer is finally calculated as `PROTECT_PTR(0x55555555bxxx, 0)`, which is `0x000000055555555b`. We could left shift its encoded address to leak this heap base address.



### Leaking libc by unsorted_bin

Leaking libc had blocked my progress for a while since I though tcache will somehow leak this information out. By following this methodology, I looked around [tcache section in CTFWiki](https://ctf-wiki.org/en/pwn/linux/user-mode/heap/ptmalloc2/tcache-attack/#libc-leak) to get an answer. However, what it has written down is not this case because it leaks libc base address by simply flooding an entry in tcache. 

Finally, I understand how `malloc(0x4f0);` in the `add` function plays a role to leak libc. Basically, this program allows us to allocate a chunk of whatever size. If we could free a chunk to **unsorted_bin**, then know where `main_arena` is, which helps us calculate libc base address because there is a fixed offset in between. 

At the very beginning, I actually made a mistake before got the libc address. I directly allocated a chunk of big size, then freed it. I was sort of confused why it had not been placed into **unsorted_bin**. Finally, I figured it out when checking source code:
```c
        /*
          If the chunk borders the current high end of memory,
          consolidate into top
        */
        else {
            size += nextsize;
            set_head(p, size | PREV_INUSE);
            av->top = p;
            check_chunk(av, p);
        }
```

Because of the freed chunk next to top chunk, ptmalloc made memory consolidation for both of them. That is to say, after I freed it, this chunk was returned to top chunk and became a part of it.

Hence, using `malloc(0x4f0);` after allocating a big chunk would stop this consolidation from happening.

pwndbg will try to resolve the heap symbols via heuristic now since we cannot resolve the heap via the debug symbols.
This might not work in all cases. Use `help set resolve-heap-via-heuristic` for more details.

    0x7ffff7fae000     0x7ffff7fbd000 rw-p     f000      0 [anon_7ffff7fae]
```

It is worthwhile to mention that `main_arena` is a global variable in libc's data section, so this is why we found this address in libc space rather than heap. 

## Poisoning tcacahe_pthread_struct

As mentioned previously, `print_shell_addr` offers us a chance to double free a tcache chunk (modify key field). Why do we need to poison tcacahe_pthread_struct, instead of overwriting a return address as the address of shell at the stack that we acquire from `environ` in libc? 

Yes, a crash arises and ptmalloc is going to panic by throwing an unalign error if you do so.
